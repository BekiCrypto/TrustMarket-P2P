## 2. Bug Fixes & Critical Patches

- **Dependency Resolution**:
  - Fixed a "Module not found" error by adding the missing `@radix-ui/react-tabs` package to `package.json`.

- **Authentication Flow**:

  - Fixed a critical post-login bug where users were incorrectly redirected back to the login page instead of the main dashboard.
