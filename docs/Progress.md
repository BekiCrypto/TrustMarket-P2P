# P2P TrustMarket â€” Progress & Changelog

This document tracks the iterative development, bug fixes, and feature enhancements made to the P2P TrustMarket application.

## 1. Initial Setup & Firebase Integration

- **Firebase Project Connection**:
  - Initial attempts to provision a new Firebase project via automated tools failed due to persistent backend infrastructure issues.
  - Successfully connected the application to the user-provided `p2p-trustmarket` Firebase project.
  - Created a `.env.example` file to standardize environment variables.
  - Configured the application to securely load Firebase credentials from `.env` variables, resolving an `auth/invalid-api-key` error.

- **Authentication Scaffolding**:
  - Implemented core authentication structure using Firebase Authentication.
  - Added Email/Password and Google as primary sign-in methods.
  - Created a dedicated, responsive login page at `/login`.
  - Implemented an `AuthGuard` to protect application routes, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.

## 2. Bug Fixes & Critical Patches

- **Dependency Resolution**:
  - Fixed a "Module not found" error by adding the missing `@radix-ui/react-tabs` package to `package.json`.

- **Firebase Authentication Flow**:
  - Corrected an `auth/popup-blocked` error by switching from `signInWithPopup` to the more reliable `signInWithRedirect` method for Google authentication.
  - Provided clear, actionable instructions for the user to resolve Firebase console configuration errors (`auth/configuration-not-found` and `auth/unauthorized-domain`) by enabling auth providers and adding their domain to the authorized list.
