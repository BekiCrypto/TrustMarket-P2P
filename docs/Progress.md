## 1. Initial Setup & Firebase Integration

- **Firebase Project Connection**:
  - Successfully connected the application to the user-provided `p2p-trustmarket` Firebase project.
  - Created a `.env.example` file to standardize environment variables and configured the application to securely load them, resolving an `auth/invalid-api-key` error.

- **Initial Scaffolding**:
  - Implemented core authentication structure using Firebase Authentication with Email/Password and Google providers.
  - Created placeholder pages for all major sections of the application (`Dashboard`, `Disputes`, `Listings`, `Users`, `Settings`).

## 2. Bug Fixes & Critical Patches

- **Dependency Resolution**:
  - Fixed a "Module not found" error by adding the missing `@radix-ui/react-tabs` package to `package.json`.

- **Authentication Flow**:
  - Corrected an `auth/popup-blocked` error by switching from `signInWithPopup` to the more reliable `signInWithRedirect` method for Google authentication.
  - Fixed a critical post-login bug where users were incorrectly redirected back to the login page instead of the main dashboard.
  - Implemented password reset functionality, allowing users to recover their accounts via email.
